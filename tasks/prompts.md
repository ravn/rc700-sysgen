## Session 17 (2026-04-11/12) — SIO-B receive + baud rate experiments

- do sio-b in mame
- you have made this work before for sio-a. Perhaps you can find it in your memory?
- explain "case discriminant"
- please add a test for this bug
- fact: Whenever you identify a bug in the compiler, always add a test
- add an issue to ravn/mame
- enable issues on ravn/mame
- now what?
- 2 (commit)
- now what?
- 1 in my own repo (file llvm-z80 issue)
- now do 2. You've seen something similar on SIO-A and fixed it. You may consider looking back in history to see what you did then.
- you have previously found that a lot of nulls could be sent at start
- now look into faster baudrates
- we cannot do dma transfers as there is no dreq from the sio
- what would synchronous mode imply
- i have full control of the other end of the serial connection. Currently it is a FDTI usb device. Can my current cable work with this?
- automatically investigate problems in session found creating tasks and issues as necessary. summarize your work and findings in the project, and commit
