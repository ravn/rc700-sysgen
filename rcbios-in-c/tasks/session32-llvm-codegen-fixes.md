# Session 32 — llvm-z80 codegen fixes (2026-05-01/02)

## BIOS size delta

| Toolchain | BIOS size | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|
| Pre-session (`main`)              | 5998 B | — |
| Post-session (`z80-close-all-issues`) | **5972 B** | **−26 B** |

cpnos-rom payload: 1738 B → 1734 B (−4 B).

The 26 B BIOS win came from compiler-side peepholes (no rcbios source
changes this session).  Bigger surface area in BIOS than in the smaller
cpnos payload, particularly because issue #76 hits CONOUT and FDC
helper paths that have many `*ptr → r` byte-load shapes.

## Historical baseline

| Snapshot | BIOS size | Source |
|---|---:|---|
| Initial Clang BIOS                       | 6021 B | CLAUDE.md "Current" |
| Session 12 (2026-04-06)                  | 5826 B | CLAUDE.md (post #62-#68) |
| Session 16 (2026-04-15/16)               | ~5952 B | bios-size-issues.md baseline |
| Session 23 (2026-04-19/20)               | 6002 B | session23-sio-flow-control.md |
| **Session 32 (2026-05-02)**              | **5972 B** | this note |

Session 23 added correctness fixes (SIO flow control) that brought the
BIOS up from 5952→6002.  This session's compiler-only fixes brought
it back down, lower than 5952, despite all the in-between functional
additions.

## What changed in llvm-z80

7 issues closed, 5 filed.  Branch `z80-close-all-issues`, 9 commits
beyond `main`.

### Closed (with measurable BIOS impact)

- **#78** LDIR aftermath DE post-state reuse — late peephole.
- **#88** Pattern-fill loop idiom (1, 2, 3, 4 byte patterns incl.
  jump-table) — new IR pass `Z80LoopIdiomFill`.
- **#64** memmove inline (LDIR / LDDR by direction analysis) —
  legalizer custom case.
- **#91** LDDR setup quality (constant-fold Size-1 + chained PtrAdds).
- **#82** BSS-spill peephole orphan-reload bug — flips long-standing
  XFAIL test to PASS.
- **#76** `LD A,(HL); LD r,A` → `LD r,(HL)` and symmetric store —
  the most BIOS-heavy fix; this is where the 26 B mostly came from.
- **#93** Carry-roundtrip elimination (post-RA peephole, path b) —
  11 B → 3 B per constant-trip-count countdown loop body.

### Filed (deferred work)

- **#92** Nested-loop DJNZ direction reversed (outer gets B, should
  be inner).
- **#94** Sequential-loops B not re-hinted between loops.
- **#95** Long-term path (a) for #93: target-aware Z80 IR pass to
  prevent the count-down → count-up IV rewrite at -Oz.

## Why no rcbios source changes

Every fix this session was at the compiler level — pattern recognition
for emissions that already existed in the BIOS.  The BIOS source
already used the canonical idioms (LDIR for memcpy, DJNZ-eligible
do-while shapes, byte-loads to non-A registers).  The compiler now
recognises these idioms more thoroughly.

This is the cheapest kind of win: no behavioural change, no new tests
beyond the lit suite, no MAME re-validation needed.  Existing
integration tests pass unchanged.

## Verification

- Z80 lit suite: 72 tests, 72 pass, 0 expected-fails (was 65/66 + 1
  XFAIL pre-session).
- `make size` in `rcbios-in-c/`: 5972 B (172 B headroom on MINI
  5.25" 6144 limit; 4012 B headroom on MAXI 8" 9984 limit).
- `make all` in `cpnos-rom/`: 1734 B payload, 4096/4096 PROM total
  (alignment-padded).
- No BIOS source changes; `git status` clean for `rc700-gensmedet`.

## Session bookkeeping

- llvm-z80 branch: `z80-close-all-issues` (9 commits beyond main this
  session, plus prior carry-over).
- Issue tracker numbering: this session covers
  ravn/llvm-z80#76, #78, #82, #88, #91, #92, #93, #94, #95 (#64
  closed via #91/#64 fix as part of memmove inline).
