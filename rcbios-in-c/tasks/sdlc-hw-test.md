# SDLC on Physical Hardware — Test Prep Notes (2026-04-18)

Follow-up to `session18-serial-speed.md`. Session 18 established the plan
(SDLC at 250 kbaud via CTC timer mode, ×1 clock, SIO-B first). This doc
captures what changed once we started preparing for a real-hardware run
instead of MAME validation.

## Decision: skip MAME, go to real RC702

MAME Phase-1 validation is blocked on two things the session-18 plan
glossed over:

- MAME's `null_modem` device is async only. SDLC framing (0x7E flags,
  zero-insertion, CRC) has no path through MAME's standard RS-232
  subsystem without a custom peer device.
- Local `mame/src/mame/regnecentralen/rc702.cpp` has the
  `z80dart`→`z80sio` fix (commit `ea7a5cf8`, 2026-04-18) but the MAME
  binary at `mame/mame` is older (2026-04-17). Needs rebuild before any
  sync-mode programming can even be tested in emulation.

Skipping MAME means the physical RC702 is the first integration point.
Chip-level SDLC validation still needs a minimal contained experiment —
see "Proposed first experiment" below.

## MAME rc702.cpp details worth remembering

- CTC ch0 → SIO-A `txca_w` + `rxca_w` (single wire, both directions)
- CTC ch1 → SIO-A `rxtxcb_w` (single wire, SIO-B combined TxC/RxC)
- CTC trg0/trg1 are driven by `clock_w` at 614 kHz (async baseline path,
  counter mode)
- CTC chip itself is clocked at `8_MHz_XTAL / 2` = 4 MHz → timer-mode
  output = 4 MHz / {16 or 256} / TC. **4 MHz / 16 / 1 = 250 kHz** is
  the session-18 number; **/ 16 / 2 = 125 kHz** is the safer target
  (see FTDI section).

## FT2232 host adapter — actual variant

`lsusb -v` on the existing adapter:

- `bcdDevice 0x0500` — D revision (FT2232H is 0x07xx, FT4232H is 0x08xx)
- `bMaxPacketSize0 = 8` — D/C only; H uses 64
- 4 bulk endpoints × 64 bytes — matches FT2232D layout
- iSerial `FT4SXZNY`, iProduct "USB FAST SERIAL ADAPTER" — generic/clone

**Verdict: FT2232D, not H.** Implications:

- Async bit-bang ceiling ≈ 1 MHz.
- At 250 kbaud that's 4× oversampling — marginal for a software DPLL,
  because drift across a long frame can eat the margin.
- At **125 kbaud** it's 8× — comfortable oversampling, still 33× the
  current 38400 async baseline.
- 62.5 kbaud would be 16× — very safe but only 16× async baseline.
- 64-byte FIFO per channel (H has 4 KB), so sustained 1 MHz capture
  depends on USB bulk-IN scheduling latency. Expect occasional hiccups
  unless the host drains aggressively.

Revised first target: **125 kbaud** rather than 250. If that works end
to end, push to 250. A later FT2232H upgrade moves the ceiling to
614.4 kbaud.

## Hardware facts from RC702-RC703 manual (extracted 2026-04-18)

Extracted from `docs/RC702-RC703_Microcomputer_technical_manual.pdf`
via `pdftotext -layout`. Figure 13 (pp. 23–24) and surrounding text.
Full pinout + MIC-variant details written into
`RC702_HARDWARE_TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md` — not duplicated here. Key
points for SDLC:

- **J1 / J2 DB-25 carry no clock.** Only pins 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 20
  are wired — standard DTE async RS-232. Pins 15 (TxC) / 17 (RxC) are
  NC on MIC702/MIC703.
- **Synchronous external-clock support is MIC704/MIC705 only.** On
  those boards, `OUT (1Eh),A` bit 1 sets a flip-flop routing a modem
  clock into SIO channel A. That port does nothing on MIC702/MIC703.
- **Z80-SIO has no DPLL.** So even if we SDLC-frame the bit stream,
  the RC702's receiver cannot clock-recover an incoming bit stream.

### What this means for the direct-over-the-wire plan

Without MIC704/MIC705 or a cable mod picking up clock from elsewhere:

| Direction | Feasibility at 125–250 kbaud sync |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| RC702 → host (TX) | **Works**: RC702 drives its own TxCB from CTC, host does software DPLL on the RxD samples via FT2232D async bit-bang. NRZI + HDLC zero-insert guarantees transitions for DPLL lock. |
| host → RC702 (RX) | **Does not work**: SIO has no DPLL; it samples incoming RxD using its own CTC clock with no phase alignment. Unreliable at ×1 even over a single frame. |

This is exactly the session-17 finding at 250 kbaud async, and SDLC
does not fix it — SDLC buys flag framing + CRC + unlimited frame
lengths, not clock recovery.

### Three ways forward

1. **Asymmetric SDLC** — fast TX from RC702, async from host. Use
   SDLC one-way for CP/NET responses (where payload volume lives);
   keep host → RC702 at 38400 async for requests. Probably 3–4x
   effective CP/NET throughput, no hardware changes, matches a real
   cable.
2. **External-clock cable mod** — pick up a TxCB / RxCB signal from
   inside the cabinet (header pin or solder to the CTC ZC/TO pin)
   and route to the FT2232 adapter and back to the SIO as RxCB. Lifts
   the no-DPLL constraint. User has said no PCB mods, but an external
   header + ribbon out the back would be acceptable in spirit —
   question worth re-opening.
3. **J8 bus expansion** (session-18 stretch plan). Orthogonal to
   SIO/SDLC entirely; different work track.

Direction for this session: if the user accepts asymmetric SDLC,
start building Phase 1 as RC702-TX / host-RX only. Much simpler first
integration — one DPLL, on the host side, which is the easier place
to put it.

## Code wired up (2026-04-18)

- `siob_sdlc_tx.asm` — 335 B. 125 kbaud SIO-B SDLC TX, NRZI, CRC-CCITT,
  flag idle, flag-on-underrun (auto CRC). 30-byte test payload with
  bit-stuffer stress patterns; 200 ms flag preamble before the frame.
- `cim_to_hex.py` — .cim → Intel HEX at 0x0100 (feeds CP/M PIP+MLOAD).
- `sdlc_receiver.py` — async bit-bang over libftdi1 (ctypes, no
  pyftdi), 1 MHz sample rate → 8×/bit oversampling. Software DPLL via
  run-length quantisation, NRZI decode, HDLC flag+zero-delete framer,
  CRC-CCITT-X.25 verify. Self-test: CRC of "123456789" = 0x906E ✓.
- `siob_sdlc_deploy.sh` — end-to-end automation:
  1. zmac + cim_to_hex
  2. over ttyUSB0: `STAT CON:=CRT:` → `PIP SIOBSDLC.HEX=RDR:` →
     stream HEX → `^Z` → `STAT CON:=TTY:` → `MLOAD SIOBSDLC`
  3. start `sdlc_receiver.py --seconds 10 --interface B` on ttyUSB1
  4. send `SIOBSDLC` over ttyUSB0
  5. print decoded frame
- Makefile target `siob-sdlc`.

### Toolchain deps (all present on this box)

- `bison` — installed (user). zmac built cleanly.
- `libftdi1.so.2` — installed (`libftdi1-2`). ctypes loads it.
- `pyserial` — installed (3.5).

### Prereqs on the RC702 for deploy

- Already at A> prompt, CON:=TTY (serial console).
- Drive A has `STAT.COM`, `PIP.COM`, `MLOAD.COM`.
- RTS/CTS flow control on SIO-A works (same as existing BIOS deploy).
- ttyUSB1 not held by another libftdi/serial process.

### How to run

```
cd rc700-gensmedet/rcbios-in-c
make siob-sdlc
```

### Session progress (2026-04-18, real hardware)

Chain confirmed working end-to-end:
1. **DDT deploy** — `ddt_deploy.py` types bytes into DDT's `S` command
   over SIO-B console, verifies with `D`, `SAVE`s as .COM.
   Replaces the PIP+MLOAD path per user directive (keeps SIO-A free
   and avoids RX ring-buffer contamination).
2. **Z80 TX** — `sioa_sdlc_tx.asm` (now targets SIO-A — session-17
   rule: don't commandeer the console channel).  Runs, prints banner,
   transmits frame, restores async.
3. **FTDI bit-bang receive** — `sdlc_receiver.py` via libftdi1 ctypes.
   Captures samples, writes raw dump for offline analysis.
4. **Decoder** — software DPLL + NRZI + HDLC de-frame + CRC-CCITT.

Empirical findings worth remembering:

- **CTC CLK on the physical PCB530 is NOT 4 MHz as MAME models.**
  First measurements suggested 8 MHz (TC=4 → observed 125 kHz)
  but that was confounded by sample drops at 1 MHz bit-bang.
  Clean capture at 80 kHz shows TC=50 produces ~6.0–6.8 kHz on
  the SIO clock, implying CTC_CLK ≈ 5 MHz (or 4.9152 MHz from
  the 19.6608 MHz video master).  Needs scope verification.
- **MAME's rc702 clock model may be incorrect for this board.**
  `Z80CTC(config, m_ctc1, 8_MHz_XTAL / 2)` → 4 MHz.  PCB530 appears
  to be different.  Worth filing a follow-up to ravn/mame once the
  scope measurement confirms the real rate.
- **FT2232D async bit-bang max throughput is well under 1 MHz in
  practice.**  Requested sample rate 1 MHz, observed effective rate
  ~273 kHz over 10 s captures — FTDI + Python read-loop drops
  samples heavily.  The raw dump shows genuine SDLC structure but
  run-lengths are scrambled beyond DPLL recovery.

### Known bugs / deferred work

- Receiver's effective sample rate << configured.  Tried (b) above —
  removed sleep, 256 KB buffer — improved but didn't close the gap.
  Dominant run length now 16 samples at 62.5 kbaud (bit cell =
  16 µs = 1 MHz sample rate ✓) but ~50% of samples are still
  dropped mid-run, fragmenting the expected {1-cell, 7-cell} flag
  distribution.  Next steps:
  (a) write a small C capture helper (libftdi1 in C, no Python
      overhead in the read loop) — most pragmatic.
  (b) drop the line baud to 31.25 kbaud (CTC TC=16) with 1 MHz
      sampling = 32×/bit, enough margin even with 50% drops.
  (c) long-term: FT2232H adapter eliminates the bottleneck.
- `samples_to_bits` now uses a DPLL-at-bit-center approach with
  3-tap median filter; tested in isolation against raw dumps, logic
  appears sound but needs real clean samples to validate.
- MAME rc702.cpp should get `8_MHz_XTAL / 1` for CTC instead of
  `/ 2`, pending more verification.

### Open questions to resolve on first run

- FTDI bit-bang permission: opening interface B for bit-bang goes
  through libusb. On this box, `dialout` gives access to /dev/ttyUSB*
  but libusb raw access usually needs a udev rule for VID:PID
  0403:6010. If the script fails with "usb_open: -5", add a rule at
  `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-ftdi.rules`:
  `SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6010", MODE="0666"`
  and `sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger`.
- Expected output: one "frame 0: NN B CRC OK ..." line with ASCII
  "SDLC-TX-TEST..." visible in the payload.  If we see "CRC BAD",
  the DPLL probably needs tuning (sample rate vs. actual CTC clock
  drift) — try `--baudrate-hint 124900..125100` to adjust.
- If the host gets nothing at all, first debug step is to drop the
  Z80 program back to async 38400 and confirm the FT2232D in
  bit-bang mode sees transitions (same cable, known-good data).

### Board version: PCB530 (2026-04-18)

User's RC702 mainboard silkscreen is **PCB530**. Neither PDF manual
names it directly; both describe PCB527 as the MIC702 reference
design. User's assessment is that PCB530 is a MIC702 revision; I
agree given chip complement and behaviour consistent with MIC702.

(Earlier I wrote that MIC704 adds a distinguishing "MIC LV" PLL
schematic — that was a misread. RC702tech.pdf p.83 contains a
"MIC 702 — PHASE LOCK LOOP — MIC 14" schematic which *is* on the
standard MIC702, but it's the video dot-clock PLL, nothing to do
with serial clock recovery. Scratch that as a distinguishing
feature.)

Treat as MIC702 until silkscreen/schematic evidence says otherwise.
Sync-mode features therefore assumed unavailable; only the
asymmetric SDLC path (fast RC702→host, 38400 async host→RC702) is
viable without cable/board modifications.

## Experiment plan (user decisions 2026-04-18)

- **Skip MAME** — go to real RC702.
- **Skip loopback** — go direct: RC702 SIO-B → serial cable →
  FT2232D → Linux host.

Consequence: clock recovery must be solved before any code lands.
There is no intermediate chip-level validation step to fall back on.
If the first end-to-end test fails we'll need to unwind both the Z80
programming and the host DPLL at once, which is painful.

Chosen first target: **125 kbaud**, to give the FT2232D's 1 MHz async
bit-bang ceiling an 8× oversampling margin for the software DPLL.
250 kbaud is a stretch goal once 125 works.

## Chip identity (physical, confirmed in session 18)

SIO: Z8442AB1 = Z80A-SIO/2. Supports SDLC. Bonding option 2 means
SYNCB pin is replaced by DTRB — SYNCA (channel A) is still available
if we ever want channel A externally synced.

## Session 21 fresh-capture run (2026-04-18 evening)

Ran `./sdlc_deploy.sh` end-to-end on the physical RC702. Chain fully
automatic:

- DDT upload of SIOASDLC.COM (343 B, 16.5 s) — verified OK via `D` dump.
- FTDI C capture on interface A, 3 s at 80 kHz — **97.2% effective
  rate (77736 Hz), zero drops in the 262 KB buffer**.
- CP/M triggered SIOASDLC; Z80 printed "Frame sent. Restoring async
  38400." on SIO-B — transmit completed.

Signal analysis of the clean capture:

- Only ADBUS1 has activity (confirms pin/cable); 96.1% high overall
  (dominated by idle tail); one active burst from sample 115452 to
  152365 (= **0.48 s at t=1.49 s after capture start**).
- 668 transitions in the burst → 1387 transitions/s, consistent with
  ~5.5 kbaud SDLC flag idle (4 transitions per flag byte).
- Burst duration (0.48 s) exceeds the theoretical 0.32 s of SIO-A
  SDLC-mode activity by ~50%, not yet explained — likely a slower
  CPU clock than 4 MHz, or longer delay-loop execution than expected.

Decoder findings:

- `samples_to_bits`' `round(run/sps)` is too brittle for the real
  line: 6-ones flag runs (~78 samples at sps=13) get occasionally
  rounded to 7 ones (abort pattern), killing frame detection.
- Implemented `dpll_bits` in `sdlc_receiver.py` — sample at bit
  center, snap phase to each detected transition. Tolerates ~±20%
  bit-period jitter. Drops into the same pipeline via `decode_with(
  use_dpll=True)`, now default.
- On synthetic ideal SDLC the DPLL matches the legacy path (all
  `test_sdlc_decoder.py` PASS).
- On the real capture at sps=13: legacy path finds 1 frame candidate;
  DPLL finds **40**. Still 0 CRC-OK, 0 payload substring matches.
- Auto-decode now reports best sps ≈ 12.96 (consistent with measured
  ~6.0 kbaud line rate at 77.7 kHz sampling, CTC CLK ≈ 5 MHz).

Interpretation:

- Decoder logic is sound (verified by synthetic tests, including DPLL).
- Bit-level flag structure is present in the capture — but the
  recovered byte streams contain no recognizable payload fragments
  across any sps/polarity/byte-shift combination.
- Hypothesis: **signal-integrity smearing on the RS-232 path**.
  Transition intervals span 1–183 samples at the 77.7 kHz sample
  rate; at sps≈13, genuine 6-cell flag runs should cluster tightly
  near 78 samples, but observed 5- and 6-cell runs blur across
  65–110 samples (≈40% spread). That's consistent with the cheap
  "USB FAST SERIAL ADAPTER"'s RS-232 receiver having asymmetric
  slew + noisy threshold, not with a decoder bug.
- Cannot be confirmed without a scope on TxD of SIO-A. Parked
  pending FT2232H arrival (better capture) or a scope session.

Artefacts added:

- `sdlc_receiver.py`: `dpll_bits()` function, `decode_with(use_dpll=
  True)` default.
- No changes to `sioa_sdlc_tx.asm` — the Z80 side is not suspect.

## Decoder characterization (2026-04-18, session 21)

`test_sdlc_decoder.py` synthesizes an ideal SDLC bit stream
(HDLC-stuffed, CRC-CCITT, NRZI, flag idle, oversampled) and feeds it
through `sdlc_receiver.py`'s decode pipeline. Establishes baselines
without hardware:

| Case | Result |
|------|--------|
| Clean @ 8 sps, 30-byte payload (matches sioa_sdlc_tx.asm) | PASS |
| Clean @ 4 sps (minimum viable oversample) | PASS |
| All-0xFF payload (stuffer stress) | PASS |
| All-0x7E payload (flag-byte stuffer stress) | PASS |
| Long leading idle (MAX_RUN_BITS cap exercise) | PASS |
| crc_ccitt("123456789") = 0x906E (X.25 reference) | PASS |
| ±6% sps mismatch | recovers |
| ≥9% sps mismatch (enc 8, dec 7.3) | fails — six-ones flag run rounds to seven, decoder sees abort |
| 10% random sample drops @ sps=16 | recovers |
| ≥20% random sample drops | fails |

**Conclusion.** Decoder logic (samples_to_bits, nrzi_decode,
find_frames, bits_to_bytes, crc_ccitt) is correct on clean input. The
CRC failures on real FT2232D captures are not a decoder bug — the
FT2232D drops ~70-75% of samples at 1 MHz bit-bang (session 20
measurement), well beyond the ~10% the decoder tolerates. Remedies
stay as-documented:

- (a) C capture helper — done (`sdlc_capture.c`), lifts effective rate
      to ~200 kHz sustained; not enough for 125 kbaud @ 8×, but fine
      for lower line rates.
- (b) Drop line baud to ~31 kbaud so 1 MHz sampling = 32×/bit; margin
      survives 50% drops on the decoder side.
- (c) FT2232H adapter to eliminate the bottleneck.

The sps-drift finding also argues for always using `--auto` in
`sdlc_receiver.py` on real captures until the CTC CLK rate is settled
by scope measurement.

## Procurement: FT2232H adapter (session 21, revised session 22)

Goal: replace the cheap "USB FAST SERIAL ADAPTER" (FT2232D + unknown
RS-232 transceiver, likely source of the 40% bit-period smear that
prevents payload recovery).

### USB-COM232-PLUS2 — unavailable (2026-04-19)

Original choice was the FTDI USB-COM232-PLUS2 (genuine dual FT2232H
RS-232 cable). Surveyed in session 21 but **all EU retailers are out
of stock** as of 2026-04-19:

| Retailer | Status | Note |
|----------|--------|------|
| [Farnell DK](https://dk.farnell.com/en-DK/ftdi/usb-com232-plus2/module-usb-to-rs232-ft2232h/dp/1817171) | Out of stock | ~3 months ETA |
| TME (Poland) | 0 stock | No restock date |
| Amazon.de (AYA FT2232H) | Out of stock | Was listed but unavailable |
| eBay UK (AYA FT2232H) | Listing ended | |
| Botland (FT2232H module) | Temporarily unavailable | |
| Electrokit (Adafruit FT232H) | Out of stock | ETA 2026-05-15 |
| Pimoroni (Adafruit FT232H) | Out of stock | |
| DigiKey DK | 64 in stock | Ships from US — too expensive with tax/VAT |

### Rejected alternatives

- **StarTech ICUSB2322F**: uses **FT2232D** (same chip as current adapter)
- **Gearmo 2-port**: uses **FT2232D**
- **FT232RL**: USB 1.1 Full-Speed, smaller 256 B FIFO, no MPSSE — sideways move
- **FTDI USB-RS232 cable series**: all Full-Speed (FT232R), none use FT232H

### Chosen approach: Adafruit FT232H + MAX3232 module (2026-04-19)

Single-channel FT232H breakout board (USB 2.0 High-Speed, 1 KB FIFO,
MPSSE capable) paired with a MAX3232 RS-232 level shifter module.
Two boards, three jumper wires. Total ~€23 from EU retailers.

**Advantages over USB-COM232-PLUS2:**
- Actually available in EU
- MPSSE engine enables synchronous bit-clocked capture at exactly
  250 kHz — eliminates the async bit-bang + software DPLL chain that
  failed in sessions 20-21
- Cheaper (~€23 vs ~€100+)
- Single channel is sufficient (only SIO-A capture needed)

**Components:**

**Wiring:**

```
RC702 DB-25 (J1)                MAX3232 module              FT232H breakout
-----------------               --------------              ---------------
Pin 2 (TxD out) --DB9 cable-->  DB9 RxD in
                                TTL TX out  --jumper wire--> D1 (ADBUS1)
Pin 7 (GND)     --DB9 cable-->  GND
                                GND         --jumper wire--> GND

Optional (host -> RC702 TX, for future bidirectional use):
                                TTL RX in  <--jumper wire--  D0 (ADBUS0)
Pin 3 (RxD in)  <--DB9 cable--  DB9 TxD out
```

Only RX direction (RC702 -> host) is needed for SDLC capture. The
MAX3232 converts RS-232 levels from the RC702's DB-25 to 3.3V TTL
for the FT232H. User already has DB9 cables.

**MPSSE capture strategy (replaces async bit-bang + DPLL):**

Instead of oversampling with async bit-bang and recovering the clock
in software (which failed due to FT2232D FIFO overflows and sample
drops), use the FT232H's MPSSE engine to clock-sample D1 at exactly
250 kHz. Each MPSSE read returns one bit per clock edge — no
oversampling, no dropped samples, no DPLL needed. The SDLC bit
stream is read synchronously and fed directly to the existing HDLC
deframer (flag detection, zero-deletion, CRC-CCITT).

MPSSE clock accuracy: FT232H master clock is 60 MHz, divided to
target rate. 60 MHz / 240 = 250 kHz exact. For lower test rates
(e.g. CTC TC=50 producing ~6 kHz on PCB530), 60 MHz / 10000 =
6 kHz exact.

**FT232H key specs (vs FT2232D):**

| Feature | FT2232D (current) | FT232H (new) |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| USB speed | Full-Speed 12 Mbps | **High-Speed 480 Mbps** |
| RX FIFO | 384 B | **1 KB** (+ USB HS headroom) |
| MPSSE | No | **Yes** (synchronous clocked capture) |
| Bit-bang ceiling | ~200 kHz sustained | ~6 MHz (MPSSE), ~1 MHz (bit-bang) |
| Async UART max | ~1 Mbaud | ~12 Mbaud |

## TODO before any code lands

- [ ] Read RC702 schematic; document DB-25 pin-out for SIO-B.
- [ ] Decide clock strategy: software DPLL (async bit-bang) vs.
      external clock wire.
- [ ] Write loopback Z80 program (see "Proposed first experiment").
- [ ] Once loopback passes, design host-side receiver (Python +
      libftdi1 / pyftdi async bit-bang + DPLL + HDLC framer).
