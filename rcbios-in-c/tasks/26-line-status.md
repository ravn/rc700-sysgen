# 26-Line Display with Status Line

## Background

The ravn/rc702-bios assembly BIOS implements a 26th screen line by
reprogramming the Intel 8275 CRT controller. This document captures
the findings from analyzing that implementation and plans the port
to the C BIOS.

## Findings from ravn/rc702-bios

### How the 26th line is enabled

In `CDEF.MAC`, a build flag controls the feature:

    crt26  equ  yes

In `INIT.MAC`, the CRT 8275 reset sequence modifies the second
parameter byte:

```asm
LD  A,CRTreset      ; 8275 Reset command (0x00)
OUT (CRTctrl),A
LD  A,(CRT0)         ; PAR1: 0x4F → 80 chars/row
OUT (CRTdata),A
LD  A,(CRT1)         ; PAR2: 0x98 (25 rows, VRTC timing)
ifdef crt26
 sub  03fh           ; VerticalRetraceCount-1, LinesOnScreen+1
endif
OUT (CRTdata),A      ; PAR2 becomes 0x59 → 26 rows
```

The `SUB 0x3F` on the 8275 Parameter 2 byte achieves two effects
in one instruction:
- **High bits (7:6)**: VRTC retrace timing decremented by 1 scanline
  (making room for the extra character row)
- **Low bits (5:0)**: Row count incremented by 1 (25→26)

The value 0x98 encodes: bits 7:6 = 0b10 (VRTC=2), bits 5:0 = 0x18
(24 → 24+1=25 rows). After SUB 0x3F: bits 7:6 = 0b01 (VRTC=1),
bits 5:0 = 0x19 (25 → 25+1=26 rows).

### Screen memory layout with CRT26

```
0xF800  ┌─ 25 rows × 80 cols = 2000 bytes (normal display area)
        │  Rows 0-24, addressed by CONOUT cursor logic
0xFF9F  └─
0xFFA0  ┌─ Row 25: status line (80 bytes)
0xFFEF  └─
0xFFF0     0xFF terminator byte (stops DMA feed to CRT)
```

In `CONOUT.MAC`, the DMA word count adapts:

```asm
ifdef crt26
  screensize  defl  800h-5    ; 0x7FB = 2043 bytes
else
  screensize  defl  screenlength  ; 0x7CF = 1999 bytes
endif
```

The extra bytes cover the 26th row (80 bytes) plus a 0xFF stop byte.
The 8275 interprets 0xFF as "end of row" (all-ones special code),
which terminates the DMA transfer cleanly.

### INIT.MAC screen clear covers the 26th line

```asm
LD  BC,SCREENsize     ; 910307 — Erases also the 26th line
LD  (HL),' '
LDIR
ld  (hl), 0ffh        ; Last visible screenbyte. Stops DMA feed to CRT.
call  n$statl          ; Display default status line.
```

### Status line module (STATL.MAC)

The status line is a callback-based system:

- `N$STATL` — reset to default (clock display)
- `S$STATL(hl)` — set callback to HL; update immediately
- `U$STATL(hl)` — update only if HL is the active callback

The callback function returns HL pointing to a NUL-terminated string.
STATL copies up to 39 characters to `scstat` (0xF800 + 25×80), padding
with spaces.

```asm
scstat  equ  0F800h + (25*80)   ; byte 2000 of display memory
sclen   equ  39                 ; max status line length
```

### Clock module (CLOCK.MAC)

The default status line shows date and time: `DD/MM HH:MM`.
Updated from the 50Hz CRT interrupt via BCD arithmetic (DAA).
The tick counter and clock bytes are:

```asm
cl$yy:  db  93h        ; Year (BCD)
cl$mm:  db  04h        ; Month
cl$dd:  db  19h        ; Day
cl$tim: db  0          ; Hours
cl$min: db  0          ; Minutes
cl$sec: db  0          ; Seconds
cl$tck: db  ticks      ; Tick counter (50)
```

The `tick` routine is called from `IntDisplay` (the CRT ISR) 50×/sec.

### Keyboard-activated status line (KEYINT.MAC)

The SystemRequest key (CLEAR, 0x8C) activates a mode menu on the
status line: `D)isk, L)aTeX, I)SO, N)ormal`. This allows runtime
switching between keyboard mapping modes (Danish, LaTeX, ISO-8859-1).

### DMA ISR (C.MAC IntDisplay)

The CRT ISR programs DMA ch2 every frame with `SCREENBASE` and
`SCREENSIZE`. No DMA split (ch3 word count = 0). The 26th line
is simply part of the contiguous DMA transfer.

## DMA split for separate status line buffer

### How the 8275 + Am9517A DMA split works

The ROA375 PROM's circular-buffer scroll (roa375.asm:893-967) proves
that the 8275 CRT controller can be fed from two DMA channels pointing
to different memory regions:

- **Ch2 (higher priority)**: serves bytes first. When ch2 reaches
  terminal count, the Am9517A automatically stops servicing ch2.
- **Ch3 (lower priority)**: takes over and serves the remaining bytes.
- The 8275 doesn't care which channel provides data — it just issues
  DMA requests until it has enough characters for the frame.

In the circular scroll case:
- Ch2: `DSPSTR + S` to end of buffer (2000 - S bytes)
- Ch3: `DSPSTR` for wrap-around (S bytes)
- Total: 2000 bytes from two disjoint regions

### Applying the split to a 26-line status line

For 26 rows (2080 characters total), the split would be:
- **Ch2**: 2000 bytes from `DSPSTR` (0xF800) — rows 0-24
- **Ch3**: 80 bytes from `STATBUF` (a separate buffer) — row 25

The 8275 requests 26×80 = 2080 characters per frame. Ch2 serves the
first 2000 (rows 0-24). When ch2 reaches terminal count, ch3 kicks in
and serves the remaining 80 characters (the status line) from a
completely separate memory address.

### Advantages over contiguous layout

1. **Display buffer stays clean**: 0xF800-0xFF9F is exactly 2000 bytes,
   no gap, no 0xFF terminator, no risk of overwriting BSS variables
2. **Status buffer location is flexible**: can be in BSS, in the gap
   between BSS end and 0xF600, or at any fixed address
3. **No memory conflict**: the contiguous approach puts the status line
   at 0xFFA0-0xFFEF, which is close to the fixed-address variables at
   0xFFD0+ — tight and fragile
4. **Compatible with circular scroll**: if we later implement zero-copy
   scrolling, ch2 handles the circular split and ch3 still provides
   the status line (would need 3-way split — see below)

### Three-way split for scroll + status line (future)

If both circular scroll and status line are wanted, we need three
segments but only have two DMA channels. Options:

a. **Copy the status line into display memory** at the scroll boundary.
   Ch2 serves [S..1999], ch3 serves [0..S-1] + status line (contiguous
   if status line is placed right after the wrap-around region).
   Complication: status line must move with S.

b. **Use 0xFF terminator** after row 24 to stop ch2 early, then ch3
   serves the status line from a separate buffer.
   Problem: 0xFF also terminates DMA mid-row, not at the end of 2000.
   Need to verify 8275 behavior with 0xFF in this context.

c. **Abandon circular scroll** for the status line variant.
   Use memcpy_z80 scroll (current) + DMA-split status line.
   Simplest and already fast enough (memcpy_z80 with 16×LDI).

Decision: start with option (c). Circular scroll is a separate
optimization and can be added later if needed.

### Memory map with DMA-split status line

```
0xDA00  BIOS JP table + JTVARS
0xDA71  BIOS code (.text)
  ...   BIOS rodata, data
  ...   BIOS BSS
        [gap]
0xF600  IVT (interrupt vector table, page-aligned)
        Interrupt stack (grows DOWN from 0xF600)
0xF680  OUTCON/INCONV tables (384 bytes)
0xF800  Display memory: 25 rows × 80 cols (2000 bytes)
0xFF9F  End of display (unchanged, clean 2000-byte boundary)

Status line buffer: 80 bytes in BSS (e.g. statbuf[80])
```

The status line buffer lives in BSS alongside other BIOS variables.
It's written by the status line driver and read by DMA ch3 at 50Hz.
No fixed address needed — the ISR programs ch3 with the buffer address.

### Current C BIOS state

- `bios.h`: `Display[25]` = 25 rows, `SCRN_SIZE` = 2000
- `boot_confi.c`: `par2 = 0x98` (25 rows, standard)
- `bios_hw_init.c:202`: `port_out(crt_param, CFG.par2)` — writes par2 unmodified
- `bios.c isr_crt()`: DMA ch2 word count = `SCRN_SIZE - 1` = 1999,
  ch3 word count = 0 (attributes disabled)
- `hal.h`: `DMA_CH_DISPLAY = 2`, `DMA_CH_DISATTR = 3`
- `hal.h`: `hal_dma_atr_wc(w)` macro exists but only sets word count
  (no `hal_dma_atr_addr` macro — needs adding)
- No status line, no clock display, no 26th line

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: CRT26 + DMA split — enable the 26th line

**Goal**: Display 26 rows with the status line in a separate BSS buffer,
fed by DMA ch3 while ch2 serves the normal 25-row display.

1. **Add `CRT26` build flag** to Makefile (`-DCRT26`)
   - Both clang and SDCC variants

2. **Modify CRT init** in `bios_hw_init.c`:
   ```c
   #ifdef CRT26
       port_out(crt_param, CFG.par2 - 0x3F);  /* 26 rows */
   #else
       port_out(crt_param, CFG.par2);          /* 25 rows */
   #endif
   ```

3. **Add status line buffer** in `bios.c` (BSS):
   ```c
   #ifdef CRT26
   static byte statbuf[80];  /* status line content, DMA ch3 source */
   #define STAT_LEN  39      /* max status string length */
   #endif
   ```

4. **Add `hal_dma_atr_addr` macro** in `hal.h`:
   ```c
   #define hal_dma_atr_addr(a) do { \
       port_out(dma_atr_addr,(uint8_t)(a)); \
       port_out(dma_atr_addr,(uint8_t)((a)>>8)); \
   } while(0)
   ```

5. **Rename ch3 from "attributes" to "status"** in `hal.h`:
   ```c
   #ifdef CRT26
   #define DMA_CH_STATUS  3  /* status line (replaces attributes) */
   #else
   #define DMA_CH_DISATTR 3  /* 8275 display attributes (unused) */
   #endif
   ```
   Or keep DISATTR and repurpose it — both work.

6. **Update isr_crt** in `bios.c`:
   ```c
   /* Ch2: 25 rows of normal display */
   hal_dma_dsp_addr(DSPSTR);
   hal_dma_dsp_wc(SCRN_SIZE - 1);   /* 1999 */

   #ifdef CRT26
   /* Ch3: status line from separate buffer */
   hal_dma_atr_addr((word)statbuf);
   hal_dma_atr_wc(SCRN_COLS - 1);   /* 79 */
   #else
   hal_dma_atr_wc(0);               /* no attributes */
   #endif
   ```

7. **Init: clear status buffer** in `bios_hw_init.c`:
   ```c
   #ifdef CRT26
   memset(statbuf, ' ', sizeof(statbuf));
   #endif
   ```

8. **DMA mode for ch3**: currently set to `DMA_MODE_MEM2IO(3)` in
   `bios_hw_init.c`. This is correct — ch3 reads from memory and
   writes to I/O (the 8275). No change needed.

9. **CONOUT stays 25 rows**: cursor addressing, scroll, insert/delete
   all remain bounded to rows 0-24. The 26th line is ISR-managed only.

Files: `bios.h`, `hal.h`, `bios_hw_init.c`, `bios.c`,
`Makefile`, `clang/Makefile`, `sdcc/Makefile`

### Phase 2: Status line driver

**Goal**: Callback-based status line, matching the assembly BIOS design.

1. **Status line API** (in `bios.h`):
   ```c
   typedef const char *(*statline_fn)(void);
   void statline_set(statline_fn fn);    /* S$STATL */
   void statline_update(statline_fn fn); /* U$STATL */
   void statline_reset(void);            /* N$STATL */
   ```

2. **Status line rendering** (in `bios.c`):
   - Copy up to `STAT_LEN` bytes from callback string to `statbuf`
   - Pad remainder with spaces
   - Called from `isr_crt` every second (not every frame — no need
     to re-render 50×/sec when content changes at most 1×/sec)

3. **Default status line**: show a simple clock (HH:MM) derived from
   the existing `rtc0` counter (already incremented 50×/sec in isr_crt).
   - BCD encoding not needed — can use integer division
   - Format: `DD/MM HH:MM` or simpler `HH:MM`

Files: `bios.h`, `bios.c`

### Phase 3: Interactive status line (optional, later)

- SystemRequest key triggers status line menu
- Disk status display (current drive, track)
- Keyboard mode switching

This phase matches the full ravn/rc702-bios feature set but is not
essential for the initial implementation.

## Verification

1. Build with `-DCRT26` for both clang and SDCC
2. MAME boot: verify 26th line visible, status line shows clock
3. Verify status line content is correct (spaces initially, clock later)
4. CONOUT regression: cursor addressing, scroll, insert/delete line
   must all work correctly within the 25-row area
5. Screen clear (^L) must clear rows 0-24 and reset status line
6. No display corruption at row 25/26 boundary
7. Verify DMA ch3 is correctly programming from BSS buffer address
8. Binary size impact: should be small (< 80 bytes for phase 1)

## Open questions

1. **Ch3 address register**: the current `hal_dma_atr_wc` macro only
   sets word count. We need `hal_dma_atr_addr` to set the base address.
   Does the assembly BIOS set ch3 address? Yes — roa375.asm:960-964
   programs ch3 address for circular scroll. The C BIOS currently
   doesn't because ch3 is "disabled" (wc=0). Adding the macro is
   straightforward.

2. **DMA mode register**: ch3 is currently initialized as
   `DMA_MODE_MEM2IO(3)` = single mode, memory→I/O read, channel 3.
   This is correct for feeding the 8275. No change needed.

3. **0xFF terminator**: with the DMA split, ch2 serves exactly 2000
   bytes and ch3 serves exactly 80 bytes. The 8275 gets exactly 2080
   characters — no 0xFF terminator needed. The terminal count on both
   channels ensures clean cutoff.

4. **Attribute mode**: the 8275 can be configured for attribute-based
   display (where ch3 provides per-character attributes). The RC702
   BIOS doesn't use attributes (ch3 wc=0). Repurposing ch3 for the
   status line means attributes remain unavailable. This is fine —
   they were never used.

5. **ISR cost**: programming ch3 address + word count adds ~8 port
   writes (4 for address, 4 for word count including clear-byte-pointer).
   At 11T per OUT, that's ~88T extra per frame = ~4400T/sec at 50Hz.
   Negligible (0.1% CPU at 4MHz).
