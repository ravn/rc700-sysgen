# autoload-in-c known bugs

## 1. C autoload hangs in FDC detect, never hands off to BIOS

**Status:** open as of 2026-05-04.  Hand-assembled `roa375/roa375.rom`
boots rcbios end-to-end; C reimplementation does not.

**Symptom:** with `mame/roms/rc702/roa375.ic66` set to autoload-in-c's
`clang/prom.bin` (padded to 4096 B, install via `make prom`):

  - PROM display at `0x7A00` shows the autoload banner: ` RC700 CL
    2026-04-15 12.15/ravn` (build-date string in `boot_rom.c` is
    hard-coded and stale; not the cause of this bug).
  - BIOS display at `0xF800` stays blank (BIOS never starts).
  - PC stuck in `_fdc_detect_sector_size_and_density` (LMA `0x02D6`
    in PROM 0; VMA `0x626E` in the RAM-relocated `.text`).
  - `mame_boot_test.lua` reports `FAIL: PROM error (see display)`
    after 10 sim-seconds (any non-blank text at `0x7A00` past the
    initial 10s window counts as PROM error per the harness).

**Comparison: hand-assembled `roa375/roa375.rom` (a136b144) WORKS.**
Same disk image, same MAME version, same FDC chip emulation.
Boots through to the BIOS prompt:

```
RC700 56k CP/M 2.2 C-bios/clang 2026-05-04 02:31
SIO-B debugging enabled (38400 8N1)
```

So the bug is either in `autoload-in-c/rom.c` (the C source) OR in
`llvm-z80`'s codegen for that source.  Not in MAME or the disk
image.

**Source unchanged since April 26.**  `git log autoload-in-c/rom.c
autoload-in-c/rom.h autoload-in-c/boot_rom.c autoload-in-c/intvec.c`
shows no commits since Apr 25.  The compiled `prom.bin` from
April 26 (1832 B) presumably worked then; the same C source
rebuilt today (1832 B) does not.  Therefore the regression is in
`llvm-z80` codegen between April 26 and today.

**Optimization-level invariant:** rebuilt with `-Oz`, `-O1`, and
`-O0` -- all three produce broken builds (different symptoms, all
non-booting).  -Oz and -O1 hang at PC=0x02D6 (in
`_fdc_detect_sector_size_and_density`); -O0 jumps PC randomly
through RAM (different crash mode).  Bug is NOT in optimization
passes alone; some lower-level codegen change affects all opt
levels.

**PC trajectory comparison (assembly autoload vs clang autoload),
sampled every 0.5 sim seconds:**

```
                 t=0.5s    t=1.0s   t=1.5s   t=2.0s   t=2.5s   t=3.0s+
assembly roa375  0x76B9    0x76B6   0x76B7   0x02B0   0xE821   0xDA8E (BIOS code)
clang -Oz prom   0x6051    0x6052   0x02B0   0x02D6   0x02D6   0x02D6 (stuck)
```

Both autoloads pass through PC=0x02B0 (in PROM 0 region, executing
the LMA copy of `_fdc_get_result_bytes`).  The assembly version
transitions OUT (to 0xE821 = BIOS code in upper RAM); the clang
version gets stuck at 0x02D6 (= `_fdc_detect_sector_size_and_density`
+ 0x09, just after a call returns).

**I/O port trace:** clang autoload writes ~108 chargen events
(loading SEM702 font), then stops doing I/O writes after t=0.04s.
Assembly autoload also goes silent on I/O writes after t=0.98s
(both continue computing without writing for some time).  The function
involved is:

```c
byte fdc_detect_sector_size_and_density(void) {
    is_mfm = 0;
    while (1) {
        if (fdc_select_drive_cylinder_head() != 0) return 1;
        dma_transfer_size = 4;
        if (fdc_get_result_bytes(FDC_READ_ID, 1) == 0) break;
        if (is_mfm) return 1;
        is_mfm = 1; /* switch to MFM and retry */
    }
    fdc_cmd.size_shift = fdc_result.size_code & 0b00000111;
    lookup_sectors_and_gap3_for_current_track();
    calc_size_of_current_track();
    return 0;
}
```

Likely failure modes (not yet diagnosed):

  1. `fdc_select_drive_cylinder_head` (which calls `fdc_seek` →
     `verify_seek_result`) returns non-zero → outer caller loops on
     this function expecting eventual success.
  2. Some interrupt-handler / IM 2 vector setup is wrong, causing
     the FDC interrupt callback to run incorrectly or never.
  3. The DMA / FDC port write sequence diverges from the
     hand-assembled ROA375.

To diagnose (next session):

  1. **Bisect llvm-z80** between commit `703d96f07a06` (last
     pre-April-26 Z80 backend commit, presumed good) and current
     HEAD.  The naive checkout-Z80-only-dir approach FAILED
     because the Z80 backend uses LLVM core APIs that have drifted
     since April 26 -- a partial checkout doesn't compile against
     current LLVM core.  Cleaner approach: bisect with full
     `git checkout <commit>` of the entire llvm-z80 tree (slower
     because of full LLVM rebuild per iteration, but works).

  2. **Asm diff:** once a regressing commit is identified, compare
     `clang/prom.lis` from before vs after.  Look for changes in
     `_fdc_detect_sector_size_and_density` and its callees.

  3. **Port trace:** capture FDC port writes via Lua
     `install_write_tap(0x04, 0x05, ...)` for both PROMs on the
     same disk and diff (see `feedback_lua_no_port_reads` for
     caveats).  Initial trace already done -- clang version stops
     doing I/O writes at t=0.04s while assembly version keeps
     going.  The clang version's chargen-load completes; FDC
     init / detect loop then does no port writes (busy-loop on
     CPU-only state, possibly polling a memory variable that
     never updates, suggesting an ISR isn't firing or its handler
     isn't updating the variable).

**Workaround:** for any work that needs rcbios standalone MAME
boot (the value-oracle MAME path -- see
`llvm-z80/tasks/lessons-2026-05-04-structural-fix-failures.md`),
install the assembly ROA375 instead:

```
cd rc700-gensmedet/rcbios-in-c && make mame-roms-rcbios
```

This is the working PROM.  Continue using autoload-in-c only for
its own development work (and for now, expect it to hang).

## 2. Banner string is hard-coded and stale

`boot_rom.c` defines:

```c
const char banner_string[] = "RC700 CL 2026-04-15 12.15/ravn";
```

The build date is not auto-generated.  Should be regenerated from
`builddate.h` (parallel to rcbios-in-c's pattern) or removed if
the autoload PROM doesn't need a build date stamp.  Cosmetic, not
a blocker.

## 3. MAME path was wrong (FIXED 2026-05-04)

`MAME = /Users/ravn/git/mame` — pre-workspace-restructuring
location, no longer exists.  Fixed to
`MAME ?= $(CURDIR)/../../mame` in commit `b6c797d` 2026-05-04.
