# RC703 BIOS Source — Torben Fjerdingstad, March 1987

## Provenance

This directory contains the **original authored source code** for an RC703
CP/M 2.2 BIOS, extracted from a floppy disk image (`RC703_Div_BIOS_typer.bin`,
raw 800KB, rc703-qd format).

Unlike the reconstructed BIOS sources in `rcbios/src/` (which were
reverse-engineered from disassembly of binary files found on disk images),
these files are **genuine development sources** with original comments,
variable names, algorithm descriptions, and modification history written by
the developers themselves.

## History and Authorship

The source has a documented chain of authorship spanning 1982–1987:

| Date | Author(s) | Work |
|------|-----------|------|
| Apr–Oct 1982 | **Karsten Dindorp & Hugo K. Holm** | Original RC700 CP/M basis software |
| Jun 1982 | **SC & VN** | Hard disk corrections |
| Jan 1983 | (unknown) | Release 1.1 baseline (RC702 version, dated 83.01.05) |
| Mar 1983 | **FK & LO** | RC703 corrections |
| Sep 1983 | **LO** | RC763/RC763B Rodime 202 hard disk support; mini DPB fix |
| Mar 1987 | **Torben Fjerdingstad (TFj)** | YD-380 partner drive support, motor timing, QQMM/QQMP/QQPP variants |

The TITLE line reads: `RC703 CP/M BASIS SOFTWARE RELEASE 1.1  83.09.14`

## Relationship to rcbios/src/

The reconstructed sources in `rcbios/src/` are based on disassembly of binary
BIOS images found on CP/M system diskettes. They cover RC702 releases 1.4,
2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3.0 using conditional assembly (`REL14`, `REL20`,
etc.).

This RC703 source is a **divergent fork** of the same Release 1.1 codebase:

- **Common ancestor**: Release 1.1 (RC702 dated 83.01.05, RC703 dated 83.09.14)
- **RC702 line** evolved into rel.2.0–2.3 and rel.3.0 with conditional assembly
- **RC703 line** added color support, RC763B hard disk, and TFj's partner drive patches

The RC703 source has two features not present in the RC702 releases:
- **Upgrade 9**: Color support (8-color foreground/background via attribute bit tables)
- **Upgrade 10**: RC763B hard disk (Rodime 202) detection and support

Both lines share upgrades 1–8 (16-bit sector numbers, Winchester drives, all
tracks, no alt regs, alt HD config, warm boot from HD, extended unit C, 96 tpi
5.25" floppies).

## Significance

Because this is original source code rather than reconstructed disassembly, it
is authoritative for understanding:

- **Developer intent**: comments describe *why* code exists, not just what it does
- **Algorithm descriptions**: pseudocode-style comments (e.g., the LINSEL line
  selection protocol in `cpmboot.mac`)
- **Hardware register usage**: bit-field explanations for SIO, PIO, FDC, DMA, WD1000
- **Variable semantics**: what each RAM variable actually means
- **Modification history**: who changed what and why (TFj's comments are
  particularly detailed about the HSTBUF overflow bug and partner drive issues)

Comments from this source have been backported into the `rcbios/src/`
reconstructed sources where applicable (shared behavior only, not
RC703-specific features).

## Build Process

The BIOS was built using Microsoft M80 assembler and L80 linker under CP/M:

```
M80 =BIOS703.MAC          ; assemble (BIOS703.MAC includes all modules)
L80 BIOS703/N/E            ; link to produce BIOS5.COM
```

The file `bioslink.703` lists the module dependency order. `BIOS703.MAC` is
the master file that `INCLUDE`s all other `.MAC` files.

## BIOS Variants (TFj, 1987)

The disk contains four BIOS configurations for different drive combinations
on drives C and D (drives A and B are always 5.25" mini):

| File | Drives C,D | Type | Notes |
|------|-----------|------|-------|
| `bios5.com` | (base build) | Binary | Standard BIOS as assembled |
| `qqmm.pch` | C=maxi, D=maxi | Binary patch | Applied with ZAP to BIOS5.COM |
| `qqmp.pch` | C=maxi, D=partner | Binary patch | Applied with ZAP to BIOS5.COM |
| `qqpp.sce` | C=partner, D=partner | Source patch | Applied to .MAC sources before assembly |

**Partner drives** are YD-380 floppy drives (128 sectors/track, 1.2MB capacity)
that replaced hard disk support. TFj's readme.doc notes: "Denne udgave er
ændret så der ikke kan tilsluttes harddisk, men istedet to YD-380
floppydrives (drive C og D)" — This version is modified so hard disk cannot
be attached, but instead two YD-380 floppy drives (drives C and D).

The naming convention: Q=Quad (5.25"), M=Maxi (8"), P=Partner. So QQMP means
A=Quad, B=Quad, C=Maxi, D=Partner.

### Workflow (from readme.doc)

From TFj's readme.doc (translated from Danish):

> With the help of TRACKSYS, drives C and D can be two physical floppy
> drives, two 8" drives, two partner drives, or one of each. (Partner
> drives can also run 8" format.) The following BIOSes can be written
> to Track 0:
>
> | Drives A,B / C,D | File | Method |
> |-------------------|------|--------|
> | mini, C,D = maxi | QQMM.PCH | patched |
> | mini, C = maxi, D = partner | QQMP.PCH | patched |
> | mini, C,D = partner drives | QQPP.SCE | edited in source |
> | Standard BIOS with changed step rate | BIOS703.TFJ | edited in cpmboot.mac |
>
> Unfortunately the programs CONFI and SYSGEN do not work.

Because CONFI and SYSGEN could not handle these modified BIOSes, TFj used
`tracksys.com` as the mechanism to install them. TRACKSYS reads or writes
the system tracks (Track 0 or 1) to/from files, bypassing SYSGEN entirely.
The `.PCH` patch files were applied to `BIOS5.COM` using the `ZAP` binary
editor (also on the disk), with patch addresses calculated as `Adr - D380H`
(the BIOS load address offset).

### Known Issues (documented by TFj)

- **CONFI and SYSGEN do not work** with these modified BIOS versions
- **QQMP had an HSTBUF overflow bug**: the 512-byte host buffer overwrote
  directory check vectors, causing drives to be set read-only after partner
  drive access. Fixed by expanding HSTBUF to 1024 bytes (moved from EE81H
  to EC81H).
- **QQMP still had insufficient space** for CHK2/ALV2 vectors, which caused
  persistent R/O status on drive C. This led to creating QQPP.SCE as a
  source-level fix instead.

## Extraction

Extracted 2026-04-10 from `RC703_Div_BIOS_typer.bin` using:

```bash
cpmcp -f rc703-qd RC703_Div_BIOS_typer.bin '0:*.*' rc703-div-bios-typer/
```

Trailing CP/M Ctrl-Z (0x1A) EOF characters stripped from all text files.

## Hardware Summary

The BIOS supports the following RC703 hardware:

- **CPU**: Z80-A at 4 MHz
- **PIO** (ports 10H–13H): Channel A = keyboard input (mode 1, interrupt-driven), Channel B = parallel output (mode 0)
- **CTC** (ports 0CH–0FH): Ch.0/1 = SIO baud rate, Ch.2 = display interrupt, Ch.3 = floppy interrupt
- **CTC2** (ports 44H–47H): Ch.0 = WD1000 hard disk interrupt, Ch.1–3 = unused
- **SIO** (ports 08H–0BH): Channel A = punch/reader, Channel B = printer/terminal
- **DMA** (ports F0H–FFH): AM9517A — Ch.0 = WD1000, Ch.1 = floppy, Ch.2 = display refresh
- **FDC** (ports 04H–05H): UPD765 floppy disk controller
- **Display** (ports 00H–01H): Intel 8275 CRT controller, 80×25 characters at F800H
- **Hard disk** (ports 60H–67H): WD1000 Winchester controller (RC763/RC763B)
- **Bell** (port 1CH), **Switch register** (port 14H: bit 7 = mini/maxi detect, bit 0 = motor)
- **RC791 line selector**: External RS-232 A/B switch controlled via SIO DTR/RTS signaling

Machine type byte (MTYPE) at fixed BIOS offset: 0=RC700, 1=RC850, 2=ITT3290, 3=RC703.
