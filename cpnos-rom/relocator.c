/* cpnos-rom PROM relocator (C23).
 *
 * Reconstructs the CP/NOS payload at RAM 0xED00 from two #embed'd
 * binary chunks that sit in PROM0 tail and PROM1, then tail-calls
 * the payload's cold entry.
 *
 * Why two chunks?  The Z80 maps PROM0 at 0x0000..0x07FF and PROM1
 * at 0x2000..0x27FF, with a 6 KB address hole in between.  The
 * payload is a single contiguous blob linked at 0xED00, but to fit
 * it in the two EPROMs we cut it at the PROM0/PROM1 boundary.  The
 * build splits payload.bin into payload_a.bin (PROM0 tail) and
 * payload_b.bin (PROM1), and this file #embed's each into its own
 * linker-placed section.
 *
 * Entry flow:
 *   reset.s (at 0x0000) DI + SP + jp _relocate  ->  this function
 *   relocate() memcpys payload_a then payload_b  ->  _cpnos_cold_entry
 *
 * The payload's cold entry address is resolved at link time via
 * --defsym (the Makefile extracts it from the payload ELF with nm).
