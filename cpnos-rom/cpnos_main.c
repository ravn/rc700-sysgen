/* cpnos-rom cold-boot driver (Phase 1 seed)
 *
 * Runs from PROM0 after reset.s sets up the scratch stack.  Phase 1
 * responsibilities (this file grows to meet them):
 *   1. HW init: SIO-A/B, CTC, PIO, IVT stub
 *   2. Netboot: request CCP+BDOS from server, load into RAM
 *   3. Copy resident chunk from ROM (LMA) to RAM (VMA 0xF580)
 *   4. OUT (0x18),A  — disable both PROMs
 *   5. Jump to resident_entry() (or to CCP cold start once netboot works)
 *
 * This seed implements only steps 3, 4, 5 to verify the LMA→VMA copy.
 * Init code runs in place from ROM — no self-relocation hop (unlike the
 * current autoloader which bounces through 0x7000 because it reads
 * Track 0 into 0x0000).  Single-pass relocation: LMA→VMA once.
