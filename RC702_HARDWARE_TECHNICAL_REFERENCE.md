## Memory Architecture

### ROM Mapping

The RC702 supports two PROMs (see hardware manual page 17): PROM0 at 0x0000 (ROA375 autoload PROM) and an optional PROM1 at 0x2000 (line program ROM). Both are mapped into the Z80's address space at power-on. Writing any value to port 0x18 (RAMEN) disables both PROM mappings, allowing the full 64KB RAM to be linearly accessible. It is not known whether the hardware enforces the PROM size to be exactly 2KB.

### Memory Layout During Boot

```
0x0000-0x07FF   PROM0: 2KB Boot ROM (ROA375) - disabled by OUT to RAMEN
0x2000-0x27FF   PROM1: Optional line program ROM - disabled by OUT to RAMEN
0x0000-0xFFFF   64KB RAM (fully accessible after PROMs disabled)
0x7800-0x7FFF   CRT display buffer (2K, 80x24 characters)
0xA000-0xBFFF   Bootstrap code copied from ROM
0xB000-0xB0FF   Working area for boot process
0xBFFF          Initial stack pointer during ROM boot
```

hard disk interface board, connected via the Z80 bus expansion connector
on the motherboard.  The full Z80 bus is exposed on this connector, and
the hard disk enclosure contains additional circuitry including this CTC.
Systems without a hard disk have no CTC2; writes to ports 0x44-0x47 are
ignored.

## Floppy Disk Format Specifications

The RC702 uses a sophisticated multi-density disk format to maintain backward compatibility while maximizing storage capacity. The system uses the NEC uPD765 (or Intel 8272) floppy disk controller, which supports both FM (single density) and MFM (double density) encoding.

### 5.25" Floppy Disk Format (Standard CP/M Format)

This is the primary format used for CP/M operation on the RC702 system with maxi floppy (standard 5.25" double-sided) drives.

#### Track 0 - Special Mixed-Density Format

**Track 0, Side 0** (Single Density FM):
- Encoding: FM (Frequency Modulation)
- Sectors per track: 16
- Bytes per sector: 128
- Total capacity: 2,048 bytes (2KB)
- Physical sector numbers: 0-15

**Track 0, Side 1** (Double Density MFM):
- Encoding: MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation)
- Sectors per track: 16
- Bytes per sector: 256
- Total capacity: 4,096 bytes (4KB)
- Physical sector numbers: 0-15

**Track 0 Total:** 6,144 bytes (6KB)

#### Tracks 1-34 - Standard Double Density

**All remaining tracks, both sides:**
- Encoding: MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation)
- Sectors per track: 9
- Bytes per sector: 512
- Sector interleave: 2:1
- Physical sector order: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7

**Total data tracks:** 34 tracks × 2 sides × 9 sectors × 512 bytes = 313,344 bytes (306KB)

**Total disk capacity:** ~319KB (including Track 0)

### CP/M Logical Structure

From CP/M for RC702 User's Guide, Appendix E:

**5.25" Mini System Diskette:**
- **Block size:** 2,048 bytes (2 KB)
- **Directory entries:** 128
- **Reserved cylinders:** 2 (Track 0 + Track 1)
- **Drive capacity:** 270 KB in 2 KB blocks
- **Sector interleave:** 2:1, zero track-to-track skew
- **Recommended media:** Verbatim MD550-01-1818E

**8" Maxi System Diskette:**
- **Block size:** 2,048 bytes (2 KB)
- **Directory entries:** 128
- **Reserved cylinders:** 2
- **Drive capacity:** 900 KB in 2 KB blocks
- **Sector interleave:** 4:1, zero track-to-track skew

The data diskette exchange format uses single-sided single-density for
maximum compatibility with other CP/M systems.

### 8" Floppy Disk Formats

The RC702 also supports 8" floppy diskettes in two formats:

#### Type 1: Single-Sided Single-Density (SS/SD)

- Sides: 1 (single-sided)
- Tracks: 77
- Encoding: FM (single density)
- Sectors per track: 26
- Bytes per sector: 128
- Total capacity: ~247KB

#### Type 2: Double-Sided Double-Density (DS/DD)

**Track 0 - Special Format:**
- Track 0, Side 0: 26 sectors × 128 bytes (FM encoding)
- Track 0, Side 1: 26 sectors × 256 bytes (MFM encoding)

**Tracks 1-77 - Standard Format:**
- Both sides: 15 sectors × 512 bytes (MFM encoding)

**Total capacity:** ~1.2MB

### Alternative RC Format (Non-CP/M)

Some specialty RC702 disks use an alternative format:

- Encoding: FM (single density)
- Sides: 2 (double-sided)
- Tracks per side: 35
- Sectors per track: 16
- Bytes per sector: 128
- Total capacity: ~140KB

This format was used for certain RC-specific software but the file system structure has not been fully documented.

## Boot and Initialization Sequence

The RC702 boot process is a multi-stage operation that carefully initializes all hardware components and loads the operating system from floppy disk.

### Stage 1: ROM Bootstrap (Executes at 0x0000)

1. **CPU Reset Vector (0x0000)**
   - Disable interrupts (`DI`)
   - Set stack pointer to 0xBFFF

2. **Self-Relocation**
   - Locate boot code (scan for first non-zero byte after 0x0068)
   - Copy boot loader from ROM (0x0069) to RAM (0x7000)
   - Size: 0x0798 bytes
   - Jump to entry point at 0x70D0

### Stage 2: RAM-Based Initialization (Executes at 0x7000)

#### Interrupt Vector Setup (0x7300)

The bootstrap establishes an interrupt vector table using Z80 Mode 2 interrupts:

```
0x7300  INT0    - Dummy interrupt
0x7302  INT1    - PIO Keyboard interrupt
0x7304  INT2    - Dummy interrupt
0x7306  INT3    - Dummy interrupt
0x7308  INT4    - CTC2 WD1000 hard disk interrupt
0x730A  INT5    - Dummy interrupt
0x730C  INT6    - CRT display interrupt
0x730E  INT7    - FDC floppy disk interrupt
```

#### Hardware Initialization Order

1. **Z80 PIO - Keyboard Interface**
   - Set keyboard interrupt vector
   - Configure Port A as input
   - Enable keyboard interrupts
   - Read PIO data port to clear any pending data

2. **AMD 9517 DMA Controller**
   - Set command options (0x20)
   - Configure Channel 0: WD1000 disk-to-memory transfer
   - Configure Channel 1: Floppy disk-to-memory transfer
   - Configure Channel 2: Memory-to-CRT transfer (auto-initialize mode)
   - Set all channel mask bits (disable all channels initially)

3. **Z80 CTC - Counter/Timer Controller**
   - Set interrupt vector base (0x10)
   - Reset channels 0 and 1
   - Configure Channel 2 for display interrupts (mode 0xD7, count 1)
   - Configure Channel 3 for floppy interrupts (mode 0xD7, count 1)

4. **Z80 CTC2 - Hard Disk Controller Timer**
   - Set interrupt vector (0x08)
   - Configure Channel 0 for WD1000 interrupts
   - Reset channels 1, 2, and 3

5. **Display Buffer Initialization**
   - Initialize display buffer at 0xB020 (DSPSTR)
   - Fill 2,000 bytes with space characters (0x20)
   - Copy "RC700" prompt and color attributes to buffer

6. **Intel 8275 CRT Controller**
   - Reset controller
   - Set parameters:
     - 80 characters per row
     - 25 rows per frame
     - Underline position and character height
     - Cursor format (block, blink, reverse video)
   - Load cursor position (0,0)
   - Preset counters
   - Configure DMA Channel 2 for display refresh
     - Set base address to display buffer (0xB020)
     - Set word count to 0x07CF (2,000 characters)
   - Enable display and show "RC700" prompt

### Stage 3: Boot Device Selection

The system attempts to boot from devices in the following priority order:

1. **Hard Disk Boot (WD1000)**
   - Initialize hard disk controller
   - Issue restore command
   - Wait for ready signal or timeout
   - Check DIP switch bit 7 for forced floppy boot
   - If hard disk fails or timeout, fall through to floppy boot

2. **Floppy Disk Boot**
   - Check DIP switch bit 7 to determine disk size (5.25" vs 8")
   - For 5.25" drives:
     - Read 0x0800 bytes (2KB) from Track 0, Side 0 to RAM address 0x0000
     - Read 0x1000 bytes (4KB) from Track 0, Side 1 to RAM address 0x0800
   - For 8" drives:
     - Read appropriate track 0 data based on format

3. **Disable PROM Mapping**
   - Write to port 0x18 (RAMEN) to disable PROM0 and PROM1
   - This frees 0x0000-0x07FF (and 0x2000-0x27FF if PROM1 installed) for RAM use

4. **Transfer Control to Operating System**
   - Jump to bootstrap entry point at address 0x0000
   - The loaded code takes over and continues CP/M bootstrap

### DIP Switch Configuration

**Bit 7:** Disk size selection
- 0 = 8" floppy drives
- 1 = 5.25" floppy drives

Other switch settings control various hardware options but are not documented in available sources.

   - Stops when TC (Terminal Count) or EOP activates
   - Or when DRQ goes inactive
   - Optimized for high-speed peripherals

4. **Cascade Mode**
   - Used to cascade additional DMA controllers
   - Expands beyond four channels

#### Programming Registers

Each channel has:
- **Base Address Register** (16-bit): Starting memory address

### Display Control Character Protocol

The BIOS display driver (CONOUT) interprets control characters before sending
data to the 8275 CRT controller.  Documented in CP/M for RC702 User's Guide,
Appendix B.

#### Control Characters

| Code | Dec | Function |
|------|-----|----------|
| 0x01 | 1 | Insert line at cursor, scroll remainder down |
| 0x02 | 2 | Delete line at cursor, scroll remainder up |
| 0x05 | 5 | Cursor left (backspace) |
| 0x06 | 6 | XY addressing: followed by H+0x20, V+0x20 |
| 0x08 | 8 | Cursor left (backspace, same as 0x05) |
| 0x09 | 9 | Cursor 4 positions forward (tab) |
| 0x0A | 10 | Cursor down (line feed) |
| 0x0C | 12 | Clear screen, reset attributes, cursor to (0,0) |
| 0x0D | 13 | Cursor to column 0 on current line (carriage return) |
| 0x14 | 20 | Mark subsequent characters as background |
| 0x15 | 21 | Mark subsequent characters as foreground |
| 0x17 | 23 | Delete foreground characters without affecting background |
| 0x18 | 24 | Cursor right (forward-space) |
| 0x1A | 26 | Cursor up |
| 0x1D | 29 | Cursor to (0,0) home position |
| 0x1E | 30 | Erase from cursor to end of line |
| 0x1F | 31 | Erase from cursor to end of screen |

#### XY Cursor Addressing

Control character 6 followed by two position bytes:
- Byte 1: horizontal position + 0x20 (column 0 → 0x20, column 79 → 0x6F)
- Byte 2: vertical position + 0x20 (row 0 → 0x20, row 24 → 0x38)

Screen coordinates: (0,0) = upper left, (79,24) = lower right.  The 80×25
display area is confirmed.  Cursor addressing order (H,V vs V,H) is
configurable via CONFI.COM (stored in BIOS ADRMOD byte at BIOS+0x33).

#### Display Attributes

Each character position has an attribute byte.  Attribute value = 128 + sum
of active attributes:

| Value | Hex | Effect |
|-------|-----|--------|
| 2 | 0x02 | Blinking |
| 4 | 0x04 | Semigraphic (alternate character generator ROM ROA327) |
| 16 | 0x10 | Inverse video |
| 32 | 0x20 | Underscore |

Attributes combine additively: e.g., blinking inverse = 128 + 2 + 16 = 146.
"Set attribute" sends 128 + value; "reset attribute" sends 128 (no attributes).

### Keyboard

The RC702 keyboard is a smart peripheral that provides ready-to-use 8-bit
character codes via PIO Port A (0x10).  No scan code processing is needed on
the host side.

Two keyboard layouts were produced:
- **RC721**: early production (serial no. before KBU723 #51)
- **RC722**: early production (serial no. before KBU722 #384)

Later productions of both RC721/RC722 changed the layout (see Figures 2 and
3 in the User's Guide, p.65).

#### Keyboard Code Map (Figure 2 — Early RC721/RC722)

The keyboard sends the following hex codes on PIO Port A when a key is
pressed.  Each key has up to four values: normal, shifted (SHIFT), PA
(function key modifier), and SHIFT+PA.

**Top row (numeric keys):**

| Key | Normal | SHIFT | PA | SHIFT+PA |
|-----|--------|-------|----|----------|
| 1 | 31 | 21 | 91 | A1 |
| 2 | 32 | 22 | 92 | A2 |
| 3 | 33 | 23 | 93 | A3 |
| 4 | 34 | 24 | 94 | A4 |
| 5 | 35 | 25 | 95 | A5 |
| 6 | 36 | 26 | 96 | A6 |
| 7 | 37 | 27 | 97 | A7 |
| 8 | 38 | 28 | 98 | A8 |
| 9 | 39 | 29 | 99 | A9 |
| 0 | 30 | 3D | 90 | 9D |

**Function keys (PA1-PA5):**

| Key | Normal | SHIFT |
|-----|--------|-------|
| PA1 | 01 | 11 |
| PA2 | 1E | 0E |
| PA3 | 05 | 15 |
| PA4 | 0E | 13 |
| PA5 | 1E | 1E |

**Special keys:**

| Key | Code | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| RETURN | 0D | Carriage return |
| SPACE | 20 | |
| BS (backspace) | 08 | |
| TAB | 09 | |
| DEL | 7F | Delete character |
| BREAK | 03 | CTRL-C equivalent |

PA keys are programmable function keys.  The PA code values can be patched
in the BIOS conversion table (see Appendix D of User's Guide for patch
addresses).

The keyboard conversion table translates raw key codes to application
characters.  The table base address depends on disk format:
- Mini (5.25") diskette systems: **0x2E80**
- Maxi (8") diskette systems: **0x4680**

Patch address for any key = baseaddress + key value.  For example, the
shifted PA5 key (code 0x1E) on a mini system: 0x2E80 + 0x1E = 0x2E9E.

The conversion table is part of the CP/M system image loaded from Track 0
and can be switched between 7 language variants via CONFI.COM (Danish,
Swedish, German, UK ASCII, US ASCII, French, Library).

### Serial Port Assignments

The RC702 has two serial ports, both active simultaneously:

- **SIO Channel A (ports 0x08/0x0A)**: **Printer port** — directly connected
  to a serial printer.  CP/M maps this as the LST: (list) device.
- **SIO Channel B (ports 0x09/0x0B)**: **Terminal port** — used for an
  optional modem, PC connection, or second RC700 (via FILEX file transfer).
  CP/M maps this as both the PUN: (punch) and RDR: (reader) devices.

The RC700 Parallel Input/Output Port is **not supported** by CP/M — only the
serial ports are used for peripherals.

The system does **not** support the IOBYTE function or the modification of
logical-physical device assignments via the STAT command.  The system does
not include the MOVCPM program.

### Peripheral Handshake

#### Printer Port (SIO Channel A)

Serial interface with RTS/CTS busy handshake:
1. DTR is asserted
2. RTS is asserted
3. CTS from the printer gates TXD (transmission)

When CTS is deasserted (printer busy), the SIO holds transmission until
CTS is reasserted.  The SIO "Auto Enables" feature (WR3 bit 5) handles
this automatically.

The printer port can be used for attachment of most printers with a serial
interface and busy control.

#### Terminal Port (SIO Channel B)

- **Transmitter**: same RTS/CTS handshake as printer port
- **Receiver**: uses DCD (Data Carrier Detect) signal to enable receiving

The transmitter part functions exactly as the printer port and could be used
for a punch device.  The receiver part can be used to attach e.g. a reader.

## Multi-Density Disk Support

The RC702's multi-density disk support is one of its most sophisticated features, requiring careful coordination between SYSGEN and the BIOS.

### Density Mode Definitions

The RC702 uses a disk format descriptor byte to specify the density and sector layout:

```
Disk Format Codes (from SYSGEN.ASM and CPMBOOT.MAC):

0x00/0xFF  - Drive type indicator (0x00=floppy, 0xFF=hard disk)

For maxi (8") floppy disks:
0x08 - DD (Double Density): 512 B/S, 30 S/T  [Standard CP/M format]
0x10 - SS (Single Density): 128 B/S, 26 S/T  [Track 0, Side 0]
0x18 - DD (Double Density): 256 B/S, 26 S/T  [Track 0, Side 1]

For mini (5.25") floppy disks:
0x08 - DD: 512 B/S, 20 S/T
0x10 - DD: 512 B/S, 20 S/T
0x18 - DD: 512 B/S, 30 S/T
```

### SYSGEN Multi-Density Handling

The SYSGEN utility must handle the complex track layout when reading or writing the CP/M system tracks (Track 0 and Track 1).

#### Track 0 Processing

When accessing Track 0, SYSGEN must:

1. **Set density for Track 0, Side 0:**
   - Switch to FM (single density) mode
   - Configure for 128-byte sectors
   - Format code: 0x10

2. **Set density for Track 0, Side 1:**
   - Switch to MFM (double density) mode
   - Configure for 256-byte sectors
   - Format code: 0x18

3. **Read/write 16 sectors per side**

#### Track 1 Processing (Complex Multi-Density)

Track 1 uses an even more complex format with THREE different density zones:

**SYSGEN.ASM defines these parameters:**

```asm
rccpmfmt:      db 08h  ; Normal CP/M format (DD, 512 B/S)
                        ; Restored at exit

rctrk1fmt1:    db 10h  ; Track 1 format for sectors < rcmaxsect1
rctrk1fmt2:    db 18h  ; Track 1 format for sectors > rcmaxsect1

rcmaxsect1:    db 19h  ; Largest sector in part ONE (sector 25)
rcmaxsect2:    db 34h  ; Largest sector in part TWO (sector 52)
rcoffset2:     db 1Ah  ; Offset for sectors in part TWO (26)
```

**Track 1 Sector Mapping:**

- **Sectors 0-25 (0x00-0x19):** Format 0x10 (SS, 128 B/S)
- **Sectors 26-52 (0x1A-0x34):** Format 0x18 (DD, 256 B/S)
- **Sectors 53+ (0x35+):** Format 0x08 (DD, 512 B/S) [actually these are on Track 2+]

The SYSGEN code must dynamically switch density modes while reading/writing Track 1:

```asm
; Pseudocode logic from SYSGEN.ASM:

IF sector < rcmaxsect1 THEN
    format = rctrk1fmt1  ; 0x10 = SS, 128 B/S
ELSE IF sector < rcmaxsect2 THEN
    format = rctrk1fmt2  ; 0x18 = DD, 256 B/S
    actual_sector = sector + rcoffset2
ELSE
    format = rccpmfmt    ; 0x08 = DD, 512 B/S
END IF
```

### Sector Interleaving

The RC702 uses a 2:1 sector interleave on data tracks to optimize performance:

**Physical sector order:** 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7

This allows the CPU time to process one sector before the next sector arrives under the read head, reducing the need for full-track rotations.

**Translation Tables:**

SYSGEN.ASM includes two sector translation tables:

1. **minitrans:** For mini (5.25") floppy disks
2. **maxitrans:** For maxi (8") floppy disks

```asm
maxitrans:  db 0, 4, 8, 0Ch, 10h, 14h, 18h
            db 1, 5, 9, 0Dh, 11h, 15h, 19h
            db 2, 6, 0Ah, 0Eh, 12h, 16h
            db 3, 7, 0Bh, 0Fh, 13h, 17h
```

### BIOS Disk Parameter Blocks

The CP/M BIOS maintains Disk Parameter Blocks (DPBs) that define the disk geometry and allocation for each drive and format type. These parameters must match the physical disk format:

**Key DPB fields:**
- **SPT:** Sectors Per Track (logical sectors)
- **BSH/BLM:** Block shift/mask for allocation block size
- **EXM:** Extent mask
- **DSM:** Maximum block number (disk capacity)
- **DRM:** Maximum directory entry number
- **AL0/AL1:** Directory allocation bitmap
- **CKS:** Directory check vector size
- **OFF:** Number of reserved tracks

### Runtime Format Detection

The RC702 BIOS and SYSGEN must detect whether the system is running on:

1. **Mini floppy (5.25"):** DIP switch bit 7 = 1
2. **Maxi floppy (8"):** DIP switch bit 7 = 0

(SYSGEN.ASM is the definitive source on this)

Based on this detection, different translation tables and sector layouts are selected.

### Challenges for SYSGEN

The SYSGEN utility faces several challenges due to this multi-density format:

1. **Dynamic Density Switching:** Must change FDC mode between FM and MFM while reading the same track

2. **Variable Sector Sizes:** Must handle 128, 256, and 512-byte sectors in the same copy operation

3. **Logical-to-Physical Mapping:** Must translate logical CP/M sector numbers to physical disk sectors with correct density mode

4. **Boundary Conditions:** Must carefully handle transitions between density zones, especially on Track 1

5. **BIOS Coordination:** Must match the exact sector layout that the BIOS expects

---

## Implementation Notes for Developers

### SYSGEN Modifications for Multi-Density

The RC702 SYSGEN differs significantly from the standard Digital Research SYSGEN.COM:

1. **Format Detection Code:** Added runtime detection of mini vs. maxi floppy
2. **Multiple Translation Tables:** Separate tables for different disk formats
3. **Track-Specific Formatting:** Special handling for Track 0 and Track 1
4. **Density Switching Logic:** Code to change FDC density mode during track access
5. **BIOS Interface Changes:** Modified to pass format codes to BIOS sector I/O routines

### Bootstrap ROM (ROA375) Development

When developing or modifying the ROA375 autoload ROM:

1. **Size Constraint:** Must fit in 2KB (0x0000-0x07FF)
2. **Self-Relocation:** Must copy itself to RAM before disabling ROM mapping
3. **Hardware Initialization:** Must properly initialize all controllers in correct order
4. **Interrupt Vectors:** Must establish Mode 2 interrupt table before enabling interrupts
5. **Display Early:** Initialize display early for user feedback
6. **Multi-Density Boot:** Must correctly read mixed-density Track 0
7. **Error Handling:** Must gracefully fall back between boot devices

### Testing Considerations

1. **Multi-Density Transitions:** Test reading/writing across density boundaries
2. **Format Detection:** Verify correct operation on both 5.25" and 8" drives
3. **BIOS Compatibility:** Ensure SYSGEN matches exact BIOS sector layout
4. **Edge Cases:** Test boundary sectors (e.g., sector 25/26 on Track 1)
5. **Hardware Variations:** Test with both NEC uPD765 and Intel 8272 FDCs
6. **DMA Timing:** Verify DMA transfers complete before next operation

## RC-Specific CP/M Utilities

The RC700 CP/M distribution includes several utilities beyond the standard
Digital Research set.  These are RC700 transient commands (.COM files).

### FORMAT (4.3.1)

Formats diskettes for use on the RC700.  Erases all data.

- **5.25" mini**: always double-sided, double-density (no format prompt).
  36 tracks formatted.
- **8" maxi**: prompts for type — 1=SS/SD (128 B/S, 26 S/T) or 2=DS/DD
  (512 B/S, 15 S/T).  77 tracks formatted.
- CP/M System Diskettes always use format type 2 (DS/DD).
- Factory-fresh 8" diskettes are usually preformatted but formatting
  improves reliability.  5.25" diskettes must always be formatted.

Version string: `RC700 FORMAT UTILITY VERS 1.2 82.03.03`

### HDINST (4.3.2)

Configures (or reconfigures) the RC763 hard disk.  Only for systems with
hard disk.  Four partition configurations available (see Appendix H).

- First logical disk is always C (even if only one floppy is present,
  making C have the same capacity as the floppy).
- Can copy CP/M system to tracks 0 and 1 of the hard disk.
- Hard disk boot requires hard disk autoload PROM (DF016, micro fuse in
  pos. 66) and CP/M system copied to HD tracks 0+1.
- **WARNING**: A new configuration erases all data on the hard disk.

Version string: `RC700 HARD DISK INSTALLATION - VERS.1.1 82.09.28`

### BACKUP (4.3.3)

Copies an entire 8" or 5.25" diskette on a one-drive or two-drive system.

- 8" diskettes may be single-sided single-density or double-sided
  double-density.  5.25" must be double-sided double-density.
- Normally copies entire disk and verifies.  With `FAST` option, copies
  without verifying.
- If an HD system has logical disk C, C may also be used as source/dest.
- Reports `BAD SECTOR ON SOURCE DISK` or `BAD SECTOR ON DESTINATION DISK`
  on read/write errors.

Version string: `RC700 BACKUP VERS 2.1 82.10.12`

### ASSIGN (4.3.4)

Assigns a format to an 8" diskette drive (A or B).  The specified format
may be `SD` (single-sided, single-density) or `DD` (double-sided,
double-density).

Example: `A>ASSIGN B:=SD` makes B: ready for single-density diskettes.

### VERIFY (4.3.5)

Checks a disk for bad sectors.  If bad sectors are found, displays total
number of bad blocks and offers to create a read-only dummy file called
`BLOCKS.BAD` to reserve those blocks.

- Creating the dummy file may damage existing files on the disk.  Copy
  important files first.
- Can be interrupted at any time with CTRL-C.

Version string: `RC700 DISKETTE VERIFICATION VERS.1.0 82.09.14`

### STORE (4.3.6)

Backs up files from a hard disk unit to one or more floppy diskettes.
Labels the floppy with an "iden" string (up to 8 chars) for later RESTORE.
Maximum 100 file references per operation.

Version string: `RC700 STORE VERS.1.1 83.01.03`

### RESTORE (4.3.7)

Restores files from a STORE-created floppy backup onto a hard disk unit.
The "iden" must match the one used during STORE.  Optionally verifies with
`CHECK` option without actually copying.

Version string: `RC700 RESTORE VERS: 1.0 82.10.06`

### SYSGEN (4.3.8)

RC700-modified version of the standard CP/M SYSGEN.  Reads BIOS, BDOS, and
CCP from a System Diskette or from a file, and writes them to the reserved
tracks of a new or existing System Diskette.

- Works with or without a previously created COM file.
- Mini diskette systems: `SAVE 68 <filename>` (68 pages of 256 bytes)
- Maxi diskette systems: `SAVE 107 <filename>` (107 pages of 256 bytes)

### CONFI (4.3.9)

RC700 Configuration Utility.  Modifies BIOS configuration parameters stored
on Track 0 of the system diskette.  Changes take effect at next cold boot.

Version string: `RC700 CP/M CONFIGURATION UTILITY vers 2.1 13.02.33`

**Main menu:**
1. PRINTER PORT

#### G.5 Mini Motor Stop Timer

- Range: 5-1200 seconds
- Default: 5 seconds
- Controls how long the 5.25" floppy motor runs after the last disk
  access.  Not applicable to 8" drives (always spinning).

**Saving configuration:**

Option 6 in the main menu saves the new configuration to the system disk.
The CP/M system diskette must be in drive A during execution.  If C: is
being reconfigured, the system must already be installed on the hard disk.
Pressing RETURN without saving exits CONFI and restores the old
configuration at next cold boot.

### SELECT (4.3.10)

Controls the RC791 Line Selector from the command line.

Syntax: `SELECT port function`

- **port**: P (printer port) or T (terminal port)
- **function**: A (select line A), B (select line B), R (release line)

Responses:
- `LINE READY` — selection successful
- `LINE BUSY OR DEVICE OFFLINE` — line occupied or device not connected
- `LINE RELEASED` — line released successfully

### USER (4.3.11)

Built-in CP/M command (not RC-specific).  Allows up to 15 logical user
areas within the same directory.  `USER n` where n = 0-15.  Default after
cold boot is user area 0.

### AUTOEXEC (4.3.12)

Modifies the CP/M System Disk to automatically execute a command line after
boot.

Two modes:
1. Execute after each cold boot AND warm boot
2. Execute after cold boot only

Example: `AUTOEXEC` then enter `CAT` to auto-run CAT on every boot.

Version string: `RC700 Autoexec vers. 1.0 10.01.83`

### CAT (4.1.9)

Enhanced directory listing.  Lists one or more filenames in alphabetical
order, shows total unused directory entries and free disk space.

Options:
- `$SYS` — include files with SYS attribute (listed in parentheses)
- `$R/O` — mark read-only files with asterisk (*)

Example: `CAT *.COM $SYS $R/O` — lists all .COM files including system
files, marking read-only ones.

### TRANSFER (4.1.7)

Transfers files between disks with format conversion.  Reads up to 32K
bytes at a time into main memory, asks user to swap disks, then writes.

- Source and destination disk formats must be specified:
  `SS` (single-sided single-density) or `DD` (double-sided double-density)
- 5.25" diskettes default to DD; format type prompt only for 8".
- Can transfer from SS to DD format (converts between CP/M formats).
- Source files larger than 32K are destroyed if written to same disk under
  same name.

Version string: `RC700 TRANSFER UTILITY VERS 2.0 82.01.05`

### FILEX (4.1.10)

File transfer between two computers via the terminal port (SIO Channel B).
Both computers must use the same baud rate and 7-bit character format
(configure via CONFI).

**Setup:**
1. On remote computer: `FILEX REMOTE`
2. On local computer: `FILEX` (interactive) or
   `FILEX destination=source` (single command)

Remote drive names use prefix `R` — e.g., `RA:` and `RB:` for the remote
computer's A: and B: drives.

The `MORED` option prevents the remote station from exiting remote mode
after the transfer.

**Cable requirements for direct connection (no Line Selector):**
- CML012 (5 meters)
- CML013 (12 meters)
- CML014 (25 meters)

**Cable requirements with RC791 Line Selector:**
- CML092 (5 meters)
- CML093 (12 meters)
- CML094 (25 meters)

### FILEX Transmission Protocol (Appendix I)

FILEX uses a blocked transmission protocol via the terminal port.

**Transaction opcodes:**

| Opcode | Operation | Request payload | Answer payload |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | OPEN | 16 bytes: filename | result code |
| 2 | MAKE | 16 bytes: filename | result code |
| 3 | READ | (none) | result + 128 bytes data |
| 4 | WRITE | 16 bytes data | result code |
| 5 | CLOSE | (none) | result code |
| 6 | END | (none) | result code |

Result codes: 0=ok, 1=does not exist, 2=full, 3=end of file.

**Block format:**
1. Start character: ASCII 35 (`#`)
2. Block size: 16-bit integer split into 4 ASCII digits (each digit + 64)
3. Data section: each byte split into 2 ASCII digits (each + 64)
4. Checksum: 8-bit, transmitted as 2 ASCII digits
   - Condition: (sum of original string bytes + checksum) mod 256 = 0
5. Stop character: ASCII 13 (CR)

Total characters per block of N data bytes: 2*N + 9.

### XSUB

Extends the SUBMIT facility.  When XSUB is the first command in a .SUB
file, it relocates below the CCP and provides buffered console input to
programs that read from the console.  This means PIP, ED, and DDT can
receive their input directly from the SUB file.

The message `(xsub active)` is displayed to indicate XSUB is resident.
XSUB remains active until the SUB file is exhausted or a cold boot occurs.

## RC763 Hard Disk System

### Hard Disk Boot

Hard disk cold boot is possible if:
1. The RC700 has a hard disk autoload PROM (DF016, micro fuse at board
   pos. 66) instead of the standard floppy autoload PROM (ROA375).
2. The CP/M system has been copied to tracks 0 and 1 of the hard disk
   (via HDINST answering "Y" to "COPY CP/M SYSTEM TO HARD DISK").

### Partition Configurations (Appendix H)

The RC763 hard disk (approximately 8MB) can be configured in 4 layouts
via HDINST.  Drive C is always the floppy (matching the physical drive):

| Config | C (floppy) | D | E | F | G |
|--------|-----------|------|------|------|------|
| 1 | 0.270/0.900 | 7.920 MB | — | — | — |
| 2 | 0.270/0.900 | 3.936 MB | 3.936 MB | — | — |
| 3 | 0.270/0.900 | 1.968 MB | 1.968 MB | 3.936 MB | — |
| 4 | 0.270/0.900 | 1.968 MB | 1.968 MB | 1.968 MB | 1.968 MB |

### CP/M Parameters by Disk Size

| Capacity (MB) | Block size | Directory entries |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 0.270 | 2 KB | 128 |
| 0.900 | 2 KB | 128 |
| 1.968 | 4 KB | 512 |
| 3.936 | 8 KB | 512 |
| 7.920 | 16 KB | 512 |

## System Diskette Generation (Appendix C)

Procedure to create a custom System Diskette:

1. Patch BIOS/BDOS/CCP as desired (e.g., keyboard conversion table).
2. Format a diskette with FORMAT.
3. Copy existing system using BACKUP, delete unwanted files with ERA.
4. Write BIOS+BDOS+CCP using SYSGEN.

**Example — patching keyboard conversion table:**
```
A>SYSGEN
SYSGEN VER 2.0
SOURCE DRIVE NAME (OR RETURN TO SKIP) A
; read the system tracks
A>SAVE 107 CPM56.COM     ; 107 pages for maxi, 68 for mini
A>DDT CPM56.COM
DDT VERS 2.2
NEXT PC
; find patch addresses for PA2, PA3, PA4:
; patchaddr = 4680h + key_value  (for maxi; 2E80h for mini)
-S4704                    ; patch PA2
-4704 04 12 .             ; change to CTRL-R
-S4705                    ; patch PA3
-4705 05 . .
-S470E                    ; patch PA4
-470E 0E 13 .             ; change to CTRL-S
-470F 8F . .
-GO
A>SAVE 107 CPM56.COM      ; save patched image
A>SYSGEN CPM56.COM        ; write to system tracks
```

## Line Editing and Boot Keys

### Command Line Editing

On the RC700 keyboard:
- **Key marked `<-`**: deletes the last character typed
- **Key marked `->`**: deletes the entire line typed

The up-arrow key (8) may be used to denote CTRL key combinations, e.g.,
`8C` for CTRL-C (system reboot/warm boot).

### System Boot

- **Cold boot (system boot)**: press the RESET button on the front of the
  console, or power on the system.  Loads CP/M from disk.
- **Warm boot (system reboot)**: press CTRL and C simultaneously.  Required
  after changing a disk in the drive (to update read-only status).

### Error Messages

All disk errors are reported as: `BDOS ERR ON d: message`

| Message | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| BAD SECTOR | Disk controller cannot read/write — worn disk, bad controller, wrong format, or damaged data |
| SELECT | Non-existent disk drive selected |
| READ ONLY | Disk has R/O attribute (needs warm boot after disk change) |
| FILE R/O | File has read-only attribute (change with STAT) |

Recovery from BAD SECTOR: retry (R), ignore and continue (RETURN), or
abort and reboot (^C).

## RC700 Emulator

Michael Ringgaard's RC700 emulator ([jbox.dk](http://www.jbox.dk/rc702/emulator.shtm))
provides cycle-accurate Z80 emulation with SDL2 display, floppy and hard disk
support, and a built-in ICE-type debugger/monitor.

Source: `../rc700/` relative to this repository.

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `image.imd` | Boot from floppy disk image (IMD format). Two images = drives A: and B:. |
| `-maxi` | Select 8" floppy mode (default is 5.25" mini) |
| `-hd HD.IMG` | Mount a hard disk image |
| `-monitor` | Enable monitor mode (F10 enters debugger instead of quitting) |
| `-speed N` | Emulation speed: 100=normal, 50=half, 1000=10x |
| `-memdump FILE` | Dump 64K RAM to FILE on exit (added for BIOS extraction) |

### Keyboard

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| F10 | Exit emulator (or enter monitor if `-monitor` is active) |

### Built-in Monitor

The monitor is an ICE-type Z80 debugger (from Z80SIM by Udo Munk, modified
by Michael Ringgaard).  Activated by pressing F10 when launched with
`-monitor`.  The monitor prompt is `>>>`.  All numeric values are
**hexadecimal** (no `0x` prefix needed).

Source: `../rc700/monitor.c`

#### Memory Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `d [addr]` | Dump 256 bytes (16x16) as hex + ASCII. Continues from last address if addr omitted. |
| `l [addr]` | Disassemble 10 instructions from addr. Continues if addr omitted. |
| `m [addr]` | Modify memory interactively. Shows `addr = val :`, enter new hex value or ENTER to advance. Non-hex input exits. |
| `f addr,count,value` | Fill `count` bytes starting at `addr` with `value`. |
| `v from,to,count` | Copy `count` bytes from `from` to `to`. |

#### File Loading

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `r file,addr` | Load file at specified address (raw binary). |
| `r file` | Auto-detect format and load. |

File format is auto-detected from the first byte:
- **`0xFF`**: Mostek format (bytes 1-2 = load address little-endian, data follows). Sets PC to load address.
- **`:`**: Intel hex format (standard `:llaaaattddcc` records). Sets PC from EOF record.
- **Otherwise**: Raw binary. Loads at specified address, or 0x0100 (CP/M TPA) if no address given.

All three formats print load statistics (start address, end address, byte count).

#### Execution Control

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `g [addr]` | Run from addr (or current PC). Runs until breakpoint, HALT, or error. |
| `t [count]` | Trace `count` instructions (default 20) with full register output per step. |
| *(empty line)* | Single step one instruction. Shows registers and next instruction. |

#### Register Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `x` | Display all registers: PC, A, flags, I, IFF, BC, DE, HL, alternate set, IX, IY, SP. |
| `x reg` | Modify a register interactively. Shows current value, prompts for new. |

Register names: `a`, `f`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `h`, `l`, `i`,
`bc`, `de`, `hl`, `ix`, `iy`, `sp`, `pc`.
Alternate registers: `a'`, `f'`, `b'`, `c'`, `d'`, `e'`, `h'`, `l'`,
`bc'`, `de'`, `hl'`.
Individual flags: `fs` (sign), `fz` (zero), `fh` (half-carry),
`fp` (parity/overflow), `fn` (subtract), `fc` (carry).

#### I/O Port Access

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `p addr` | Read port via `cpu_in(addr)`, optionally write new value via `cpu_out(addr, val)`. |

Useful for inspecting RC702 hardware state (e.g., `p 4` reads FDC main status register).

#### Breakpoints

Software breakpoints (replace opcode with HALT). Requires compile-time `SBSIZE` define.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `b` | List all breakpoints (number, address, pass count, current counter). |
| `b addr[,pass]` | Set breakpoint at addr. Triggers after `pass` hits (default 1). Auto-assigns number. |
| `b0 addr` | Set breakpoint #0 explicitly. |
| `b0 c` | Clear breakpoint #0 (restores original opcode). |

#### Execution History

Requires compile-time `HISIZE` define. Records PC + all register values per instruction.

| Command | Description |

| `S` | Swap drives 0 and 1. |

#### Other Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `n` | Dump CRT screen buffer contents. |
| `c` | Measure emulated CPU clock frequency (runs tight loop for 3 seconds). |
| `s` | Show compile-time settings (history size, breakpoint count, T-state support). |
| `?` | Show command summary. |
| `q` | Quit emulator. |

#### CPU Error Codes

The monitor reports these when execution stops:

| Error | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| OPHALT | HALT opcode reached (not a breakpoint) |
| IOTRAP | I/O trap (unhandled port access) |
| OPTRAP1/2/4 | Unimplemented opcode (1, 2, or 4 bytes) |
| USERINT | User interrupt (Ctrl+C or timer) |

### Workflow: Writing an Assembled BIOS to Disk

The monitor can patch a newly assembled BIOS into the system image in
memory, then SYSGEN writes it to disk with correct multi-density formatting.

**Background:** SYSGEN reads and writes the *complete* CP/M system — CCP,
BDOS, configuration sectors, INIT code, and BIOS — across all system
tracks.  The system image is buffered at `LOADP EQU 0x0900` (from
`sysgen/SYSGEN.ASM`).  Mini systems use 68 pages (17,408 bytes), maxi
systems use 107 pages (27,392 bytes).  The assembled BIOS `.cim` file
contains only the INIT+BIOS portion (starting at disk offset 0), not the
CCP or BDOS which reside on later tracks.

**Procedure:**

1. Build the BIOS variant:
   ```
   cd rcbios && make rel23-maxi
   ```
   This produces `zout/BIOS.cim` (raw binary, offset 0 = address START).

2. Launch the emulator with monitor enabled:
   ```
   rc700-sdl2 -monitor -maxi image.imd
   ```

3. After CP/M boots to `A>`, run SYSGEN and read the full system from
   the source disk:
   ```
   A>SYSGEN
   SOURCE DRIVE NAME (OR RETURN TO SKIP) A
   SOURCE ON A, THEN TYPE RETURN
   ```
   Press RETURN.  SYSGEN reads all system tracks (CCP + BDOS + config +
   INIT + BIOS) into memory at 0x0900.  It prints `FUNCTION COMPLETE`.

4. Before answering the destination prompt, press **F10** to enter the
   monitor.

5. Overwrite the INIT+BIOS portion with the new assembled code:
   ```
   >>> r /path/to/zout/BIOS.cim,900
   ```
   This patches the config+INIT+BIOS at the start of the buffer (offset
   0x0900) while leaving CCP and BDOS intact at higher offsets.

6. Resume CP/M:
   ```
   >>> g
   ```

7. Specify the destination drive when prompted.  SYSGEN writes the
   patched system image to disk with correct multi-density formatting.

**Peeking at memory while CP/M is running:**

Press F10 at any time to freeze execution and inspect Z80 memory. Use `d`
to dump memory, `l` to disassemble, `x` to check registers. Press `g` to
resume. This is useful for verifying that BIOS data was loaded correctly
before running SYSGEN.

## RC702E Variant — Memory Disk and SEM702 Character Generator

Source: `roa375/PHE358A.MAC` — a modified autoload PROM by Stig Christensen (24 Oct 1987) for an RC702 variant designated "RC702E". Replaces hard disk (WD1000) boot with memory disk boot and adds character generator loading. See `roa375/PHE358A_ANALYSIS.md` for the full analysis.

### Memory Disk (RAM Disk)

An external RAM disk peripheral accessed via DMA Channel 0 (replacing the WD1000 hard disk).

**I/O Ports:**

```
0xEE  MDTRK (W)  - Track register; writing also clears pending errors
0xEE  MDST  (R)  - Status register
0xEF  MDSEC (W)  - Sector register; writing starts the DMA transfer
```

**Status Register (port 0xEE, read):**
- Bit 0: Parity error
- Bit 1: Busy (transfer in progress)
- Bits 7–2: Number of tracks (value after `AND 0xFC`)

**Disk Geometry:** 1024-byte sectors, 16 sectors per track, variable number of tracks (read from status register). Boot image at track 0, sector 128.

### SEM702 Character Generator

A programmable character generator RAM for the CRT display, loaded at boot from a font PROM at address 0x2000.

**I/O Ports:**

```
0xD1  CHARLN  - Character number (0–127)
0xD2  DOTLN   - Dot line number (0–15)
0xD3  CHARDA  - Character pixel data (8 bits per dot line)
```

**Character Format:** 128 characters × 16 dot lines × 8 pixels = 2048 bytes of font data. Each byte is bit-reversed (MSB↔LSB) during loading, suggesting opposite pixel endianness between the font PROM and the SEM702 hardware.
